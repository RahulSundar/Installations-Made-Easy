# Installations Made Easy

This repository is for those who face barriers to entry when migrating to Linux based environments for the first time and also for those who wish to automate most of their crucial installations.
The motivation behind such a migration could be:

1. "Linux is the best!"
2. "I have to run some softwares which run better on linux based environments"
3. "I want to code and do that better..."
....
And so on..

As a beginner, I had my own issues migrating to the linux environment. However, I had some guardian angels help ease the pain in learning and migrating to linux.
So through this repository I plan to return that favour to many of you, who are first timers

Migrating to a linux environment typically involved the following stages for me:

1. Dual booting OS - "To dual boot or not to" 
2. Installation of drivers
3. Dependencies and essential packages download
4. Virtual Environments
5. Software/Package installations:
  5.1. Machine learning based packages
  5.2. Computational Mechanics based packages
6. Installation of IDEs
7. Learning to code and understand code and the linux environment better...
8. A burning desire to ease the pain of others in their learning process
