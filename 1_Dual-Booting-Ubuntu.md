# Dual Booting Ubuntu and Windows made easy:

Let me start by asking this one question. 
Why should one take the pain in dual booting to a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Current_development) based OS first of all?
Well, the answer unravels in multiple folds:
1. Linux is [Open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (Many of them are free, which means you have lots of options to choose from!)
2. Linux is great!!!(Wish I could stop here! ;))
3. You just have significantly more control
4. You would learn to code better as you get to understand key concepts of computer science better..
5. Lot of usage and development of opensource softwares/applications/codes are more friendly in a linux based environment. 

So all said and done, the above reasons are just among the many and hence you could have a completely different reason to migrate to linux.
As mentioned earlier there are many [linux disributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions) one can choose from and the most popular ones are [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu), [Fedora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)) and [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian). 
In this version of my post I shall discuss installation of Ubuntu as your second OS along with Windows without breaking your system (Extremely crucial).
In the method descibed below, we proceed by creating a bootable pendrive and proceeding with the installation of Ubuntu (version X of your choice)
So, let's begin.

## Checklist
Firstly, here is a checlist you should be ready with:
1. [A patient mind and well rested body](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/uz2209)(Always necessary, my friend!) or an urgent need or just extreme enthusiasm..;)  
2. A *16GB* pendrive
3. [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/): A software to create bootable pendrive
4. The Ubuntu version of your choice (Latest being [20.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)) downloaded in Windows. (Note: LTS stands for Long term Support upto 5 years since release. So I suggest always going for those versions with LTS)
For older versions: check out [this link](https://ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads)
5. A backup of your important files/folders/applications. (Allways better to be safe than sorry.)
6. Sufficient space in your harddrive. (Atleast *150 Gb*)
